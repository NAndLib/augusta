#### Week 5 Progress [September 5th - September 12th]
### Last week's accomplishments: [week 4](week4.md)
Alright! Week 4 was actually a pretty good week! I followed Calvin's advice to
split things up a bit more granularly and that really helped! I was able to
complete MOST of what I set out to do during the week. However, the
**Employment** and **TA** sections are still being somewhat neglected.

case study can actually be tested.

accordingly.
