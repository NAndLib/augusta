#### Week 5 Progress [September 5th - September 12th]
### Last week's accomplishments: [week 4](week4.md)
Alright! Week 4 was actually a pretty good week! I followed Calvin's advice to
split things up a bit more granularly and that really helped! I was able to
complete MOST of what I set out to do during the week. However, the
**Employment** and **TA** sections are still being somewhat neglected.

## Cozy
- The Myria case study have all the files and Makefile rules that I think are
necessary! This was a lot harder than I initially thought.
- The only thing left to do is figure out how to get PostgreSQL to work so the
case study can actually be tested.
- Mike has been emailed about the current progress on Myria.

## Augusta
- The SQLite database is UP.
- The previous `add` and `addSID` manager methods have also been refactored
accordingly.

## Teaching Assistance:
- Haha.

## Employment: 
- The website is now complete.
