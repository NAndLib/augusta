#### Week 2 Progress [August 9th - August 16th]
### Last week's accomplishments:
## Augusta:
- Repo up and running.
- Augusta **now has an architecture** and she can already receive events from
Slack.
- Foundation for parsing commands.

## Teaching Assistance:
- Completed application.

## Employment:
- Resume has been reformatted and updated.
- Contacts section on website is done. Website now has dark theme.

## Cozy:
- Redesigned nightly run.
- Ran `lazy_filter` and `swapping_foldsum` for 8 hours. _NO_ change. However,
`lazy_filter` requires at least 3-5 hours to reach the same solution as
without the flag.
